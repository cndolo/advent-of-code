This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code Puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/).

My goal is not to produce the cleanest, fastest, shortest pieces of code.

Instead, I strive to get a working solution as fast as possible.

Maybe, I will refactor the code some day.

# 2020

    - The little I did was done is Rust.

# 2021

    - I am solving the puzzles this year in Go and Rust in an alternating manner.
